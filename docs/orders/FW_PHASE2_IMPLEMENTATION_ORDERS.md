## 🚨 **PHASE 2 ORDERS - CRITICAL MODULE INTEGRATION**

### **🎯 PHASE 2 OBJECTIVE:**
Transform standalone register reading thành **integrated module safety system** với **real-time critical module monitoring** và **automated E-Stop triggers**.

### **⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY WARNINGS:**

**🚨 PHASE 2 IS SAFETY-CRITICAL:**
- **Modifying existing safety_monitor_update()** - High risk
- **Integrating với E-Stop system** - Critical safety impact
- **Real-time performance requirements** - Must maintain < 100ms E-Stop
- **Module timeout detection** - Critical for system safety

**🛡️ MANDATORY SAFETY PROCEDURES:**
- **BACKUP safety_monitor.c before ANY modification**
- **TEST every integration step in isolated environment**
- **MEASURE E-Stop response time after every change**
- **NEVER commit code that affects existing E-Stop functionality**
- **GET Safety Engineer approval before modifying safety_monitor_update()**

## 📋 **PHASE 2 TASK ORDERS**

### **🎯 ORDER #2.1: CRITICAL MODULE DETECTION LOGIC (Ngày 1-3)**

**📋 Implementation Orders:**

**Day 1: Architecture Design**
```
FW Dev MUST design module priority system:

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
1. CREATE module classification system:
   - Critical modules: Safety (0x03), Power (0x02)
   - Important modules: Travel (0x04), Lifter (0x05)
   - Optional modules: Dock (0x06)

2. DEFINE timeout strategies:
   - Safety Module: 0ms timeout (immediate E-Stop)
   - Power Module: 5000ms timeout (5s grace period)
   - Travel/Lifter: 1000ms timeout (warning mode)
   - Dock: 10000ms timeout (log only)

3. DESIGN action escalation:
   - LOG_ONLY → WARNING → DEGRADED → ESTOP_DELAYED → ESTOP_IMMEDIATE

DELIVERABLE: Architecture diagram và module priority matrix
DEADLINE: End of Day 1
REVIEW: FW Lead approval required
```

**Day 2-3: Implementation**
```
FW Dev implement detection logic:

IMPLEMENTATION ORDERS:
1. CREATE new file: safety_integration/critical_module_detector.c/.h
2. IMPLEMENT module health checking function
3. INTEGRATE với existing registry_get() API
4. ADD timeout calculation logic
5. CREATE safety action handlers

SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:
- USE existing registry API (do not modify)
- HANDLE all error conditions gracefully
- LOG all module state changes
- MAINTAIN performance < 1ms overhead per check

TEST REQUIREMENTS:
- Test với all 5 modules online
- Test với each module offline individually
- Test timeout detection accuracy
- Verify no impact on existing functionality
```

**✅ Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Module detection logic implemented
- [ ] Timeout calculation accurate
- [ ] Safety action handlers working
- [ ] Performance requirements met (< 1ms overhead)
- [ ] No existing code modified
- [ ] All tests passing

### **🎯 ORDER #2.2: E-STOP TRIGGER INTEGRATION (Ngày 4-5)**

**📋 Implementation Orders:**

**🚨 EXTREME CAUTION REQUIRED:**
```
This task modifies SAFETY-CRITICAL E-Stop system.
MANDATORY procedures:

BEFORE STARTING:
1. BACKUP entire safety system:
   - cp firmware_new/src/app/core/safety_monitor.c safety_monitor.c.pre-phase2
   - git commit -m "[BACKUP] Safety monitor before Phase 2 integration"
   
2. NOTIFY Safety Engineer:
   - Email: "Starting E-Stop integration - Phase 2.2"
   - Request: Safety Engineer standby for immediate review
   
3. PREPARE rollback plan:
   - Document current E-Stop response time baseline
   - Test existing E-Stop functionality thoroughly
   - Verify rollback procedure
```

**Day 4: E-Stop Integration Design**
```
FW Dev MUST design integration approach:

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
1. ANALYZE existing safety_monitor_trigger_emergency_stop():
   - Understand current implementation
   - Identify integration points
   - Document current behavior

2. DESIGN wrapper functions:
   - safety_rs485_trigger_immediate_estop() → calls existing function
   - safety_rs485_trigger_delayed_estop() → adds delay logic
   - safety_rs485_trigger_warning() → sets warning state

3. PLAN integration sequence:
   - Add module checking AFTER existing LiDAR checks
   - Use static timing variables
   - Preserve existing function flow

DELIVERABLE: Integration design document
REVIEW: Safety Engineer MUST approve before implementation
```

**Day 5: Careful Integration**
```
FW Dev implement với EXTREME CARE:

INTEGRATION ORDERS:
1. MODIFY safety_monitor_update() function:
   - ADD module checking logic AFTER existing code
   - USE static timestamps để control frequency
   - CALL new functions without affecting existing flow
   
2. MEASURE performance after each change:
   - E-Stop response time must remain < 100ms
   - Overall cycle time must remain < 10ms
   - Memory usage must not increase significantly

3. TEST incrementally:
   - Test after adding each function call
   - Verify existing functionality unchanged
   - Test E-Stop triggers with module disconnection

SAFETY VALIDATION:
- Test E-Stop response time 10 times
- Verify LiDAR safety still working
- Test hardware E-Stop button still functional
- Validate all existing safety tests still pass
```

**✅ Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] E-Stop integration working
- [ ] E-Stop response time < 100ms maintained
- [ ] Module-triggered E-Stop functional
- [ ] All existing safety tests passing
- [ ] Safety Engineer approval obtained
- [ ] Performance requirements met

1. CREATE response level processor:
   - Analyze Safety Module status codes (0-4)
   - Evaluate individual sensor thresholds
   - Determine appropriate response level
   - Execute corresponding actions

2. IMPLEMENT response actions:
   - NORMAL: Continue operation, green LED

   - CRITICAL: Prepare E-Stop, red blink LED
   - EMERGENCY: Immediate E-Stop, red solid LED
   - FAULT: System fault handling, red/yellow LED

3. ADD adaptive polling:
