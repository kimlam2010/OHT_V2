| UART1 | `/dev/ttyS1` | Hardware UART1 | Base UART device | ✅ VERIFIED |

## 🧪 Verification Tests Performed

### GPIO Pin Tests
For each GPIO pin, the following tests were performed:

1. **Export Test** - Verify pin can be exported to userspace
2. **Directory Existence** - Confirm GPIO directory created in `/sys/class/gpio/`
3. **Direction Setting** - Test ability to set pin as output
4. **Value Setting** - Test ability to set pin value to 0
5. **Value Reading** - Test ability to read pin value
6. **Toggle Test** - Test pin can be toggled high/low correctly
7. **Cleanup** - Verify pin can be unexported properly

### RS485 Interface Tests
1. **Device Existence** - Verify `/dev/ttyOHT485` exists
2. **Device Type** - Confirm it's a character device
3. **Base UART** - Verify `/dev/ttyS1` (UART1) exists
