## 2. SERVICE DESIGN OVERVIEW

### 2.1 Service Design Principles
The Backend Services follow these design principles:
- **Single Responsibility:** Each service has one clear purpose
- **Loose Coupling:** Services communicate through well-defined interfaces
- **High Cohesion:** Related functionality is grouped together
- **Stateless Design:** Services maintain no client state between requests
- **Fault Tolerance:** Services handle failures gracefully
- **Observability:** Services provide comprehensive monitoring and logging

        self.service_url = service_url
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.session = aiohttp.ClientSession()
    
    async def call_service(self, endpoint: str, method: str = "GET", 
                          data: Dict = None) -> Dict:
        """Make synchronous service call"""
        url = f"{self.service_url}{endpoint}"
        
        try:
            async with self.session.request(
                method, url, json=data, timeout=self.timeout
            ) as response:
                return await response.json()
        except Exception as e:
            await self.log_error(f"Service call failed: {e}")
            raise
```

### 6.2 Asynchronous Communication
```python
# Event-Driven Communication
class EventBus:
    def __init__(self):
        self.subscribers = defaultdict(list)
        self.event_store = []
    
    async def publish_event(self, event_type: str, event_data: Dict):
        """Publish event to all subscribers"""
        event = {
            "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
            "type": event_type,
            "data": event_data,
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        }
        
        # Store event
        self.event_store.append(event)
        
        # Notify subscribers
        for handler in self.subscribers[event_type]:
            try:
                await handler(event)
            except Exception as e:
                await self.log_error(f"Event handler failed: {e}")
    
    async def subscribe(self, event_type: str, handler: Callable):
        """Subscribe to event type"""
        self.subscribers[event_type].append(handler)
```

### 6.3 Real-time Communication
```python
# WebSocket Communication
class WebSocketManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connections = set()
        self.message_queue = asyncio.Queue()
    
    async def broadcast_message(self, message: Dict):
        """Broadcast message to all connected clients"""
        if not self.connections:
            return
        
        # Add message to queue
        await self.message_queue.put(message)
        
        # Broadcast to all connections
        disconnected = set()
        for connection in self.connections:
            try:
                await connection.send_json(message)
            except Exception:
                disconnected.add(connection)
        
        # Remove disconnected clients
        self.connections -= disconnected
    
    async def add_connection(self, websocket):
        """Add new WebSocket connection"""
        self.connections.add(websocket)

    def register_service(self, service_name: str, service_class: type, 
                        dependencies: List[str] = None):
        """Register service with dependencies"""
        self.services[service_name] = service_class
        self.dependencies[service_name] = dependencies or []
    
    async def get_service(self, service_name: str):
        """Get service instance with resolved dependencies"""
        if service_name not in self.services:
            raise ValueError(f"Service {service_name} not registered")
        
        # Resolve dependencies
        resolved_deps = {}
        for dep in self.dependencies[service_name]:
            resolved_deps[dep] = await self.get_service(dep)
        
        # Create service instance
        service_class = self.services[service_name]
        return service_class(**resolved_deps)
```

### 7.2 Circuit Breaker Pattern
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold: int = 5, 
                 recovery_timeout: int = 60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.recovery_timeout = recovery_timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
    
    async def call(self, func: Callable, *args, **kwargs):
        """Execute function with circuit breaker protection"""
        if self.state == "OPEN":
            if self._should_attempt_reset():
                self.state = "HALF_OPEN"
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpenError()
        
        try:
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            self._on_success()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self._on_failure()
            raise
    
    def _on_success(self):
        """Handle successful call"""
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.state = "CLOSED"
    
    def _on_failure(self):
        """Handle failed call"""
        self.failure_count += 1
        self.last_failure_time = time.time()
        
        if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
            self.state = "OPEN"
    
    def _should_attempt_reset(self) -> bool:
        """Check if circuit breaker should attempt reset"""
        if not self.last_failure_time:
            return True
        
        return (time.time() - self.last_failure_time) > self.recovery_timeout
